Inspired by Proton’s commitment to protecting user data, our mission is to empower individuals and organizations with open-source cybersecurity tools that are secure, user-friendly, and accessible. We aim to build a trusted platform that fosters collaboration and innovation in the fight for a safer internet.

## About

CyberTools is a collection of open-source cybersecurity tools designed to enhance online privacy and security. Our tools are developed with a focus on:

- **Security**: Implementing robust, audited mechanisms to safeguard against threats.
- **Usability**: Creating intuitive interfaces for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Encouraging community contributions to drive innovation.

## Tools

This repository will host a variety of privacy-focused cybersecurity tools, including:
- [Password Generator](tools/password-generator/README.md): Generate strong, unique passwords.
- [Encrypted File Storage](tools/encrypted-storage/README.md): Securely store and encrypt files.
- [VPN Client](tools/vpn-client/README.md): A lightweight VPN client for secure browsing.
- More tools to be added as the project grows.

Each tool is crafted to meet high standards of security and usability, with detailed documentation to ensure ease of use.
